## BlockDumper

BlockDumper is a Fabric client mod that renders all items as they appear in inventory, saving them to `.png` files.

**Epilepsy warning: BlockDumper piggybacks Minecraft's rendering system. All renders appear on-screen.  
If you are prone to seizures due to flashing lights, please exercise caution, particularly with large renders.**
This warning will also display ingame prior to renders running.

## Features

Render blocks as they appear in inventory at Pretty Much Any(TM) resolution.
Also render items, because I needed both.

## TODO

* Clean up code
* Render all blocks, not just ones that render in inventory
* Render all block states
* Render specifiable subsets of items
* Features, customizability, accessibility, etc.
* Fix off-by-one render locations for certain window sizes
